In a multi-threaded web server,
each client request is handled by
a separate thread. Using ThreadGroup,
we can monitor and manage all client handler threads efficiently.

ğŸ’» Scenario:
A server application creates a new thread for every
connected client. If the server needs to shut down,
it can interrupt all client threads at once.
